<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Tractor Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural tractor tyres market comprises two main types: radial and bias (crossply) agriculture tires. Radial agriculture tires feature a flexible sidewall and a tread that allows for better traction and reduced soil compaction, enhancing fuel efficiency and performance. Bias agriculture tires, on the other hand, have a stiffer sidewall with layers crisscrossing at an angle, providing durability and stability. While radial tires are favored for modern farming practices, bias tires are often chosen for their lower initial cost and robustness in rugged conditions.</p></p>
