<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermistors for Automotive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PTC Type</li><li>NTC Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermistors are temperature-sensitive resistors used in automotive applications to monitor and control temperatures. There are two main types: NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) and PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient). NTC thermistors decrease resistance as temperature rises, making them ideal for precise temperature measurements in engines and sensors. In contrast, PTC thermistors increase resistance with temperature, often used for overcurrent protection and self-regulating heating in applications like seat heaters. Both types enhance vehicle safety and efficiency by ensuring optimal temperature management.</p></p>
