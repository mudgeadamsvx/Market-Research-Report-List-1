<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy for Age-related Macular Degeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Subretinal</li><li>Intravitreal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) primarily involves two delivery methods: subretinal and intravitreal. Subretinal delivery involves injecting therapeutic genes directly beneath the retina, targeting retinal cells more precisely for enhanced efficacy. In contrast, intravitreal injection involves administering the gene therapy into the vitreous gel of the eye, allowing for broader distribution throughout the ocular tissues. Both methods aim to address the underlying genetic causes of AMD, potentially improving vision and slowing disease progression.</p></p>
