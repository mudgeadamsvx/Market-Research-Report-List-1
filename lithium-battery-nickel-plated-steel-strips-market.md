<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lithium Battery Nickel Plated Steel Strips Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nickel Pre-Plating</li><li>Nickel Post-Plating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lithium battery nickel plated steel strips market can be categorized into two main types: nickel pre-plating and nickel post-plating. Nickel pre-plating involves applying a nickel layer to steel strips before they are fabricated into battery components, enhancing corrosion resistance and conductivity. In contrast, nickel post-plating occurs after the steel strips have been manufactured, providing an additional protective layer. Both methods aim to improve the performance and longevity of lithium batteries by optimizing the properties of the steel used.</p></p>
