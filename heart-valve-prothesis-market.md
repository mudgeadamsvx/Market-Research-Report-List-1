<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Valve Prothesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Heart Valves</li><li>Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Mechanical Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart valve prosthesis market comprises three main types: transcatheter heart valves, tissue heart valves, and mechanical heart valves. Transcatheter heart valves are minimally invasive devices implanted via catheter, suited for high-risk patients. Tissue heart valves, made from biological materials, offer natural function but may require replacement after 10-20 years. Mechanical heart valves, constructed from durable materials like titanium or carbon, provide longevity but necessitate lifelong anticoagulation therapy to prevent blood clots. Each type caters to specific patient needs and clinical scenarios.</p></p>
